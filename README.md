BMI Calculator
This is a simple BMI (Body Mass Index) Calculator built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to quickly determine their BMI based on their height and weight inputs. The calculator provides both the BMI score and the category it falls into, such as Underweight, Normal weight, Overweight, or Obesity.

How It Works

Input: Users enter their height in centimeters and weight in kilograms.
Calculation: The calculator computes BMI using the formula:
BMI = weight (kg) / (height (m))^2

Result: It displays the BMI value along with the weight category.

Categories

Underweight: BMI < 18.5
Normal weight: BMI 18.5 - 24.9
Overweight: BMI 25 - 29.9
Obesity: BMI â‰¥ 30
